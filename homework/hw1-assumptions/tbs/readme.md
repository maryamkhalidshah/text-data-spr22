This is an example folder to illustrate using a personal folder to work on homeworks. 

- add a folder next to this one with your initials
- commit to a branch `hw1-<INITIALS>` and start a pull request into main. 
- commit often! Think of it like saving your progress in a game. 
- Use the merge request page to ask questions, request reviews, etc.
